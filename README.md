The data set we have is a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file named
"DataScienceSalaries.csv". The CSV file format is commonly used for storing tabular 
data in a plain-text format, making it easy to read, share, and import into various data 
analysis tools and programming languages.
The dataset covers a range of factors that can influence the salaries of data science 
professionals, such as experience level, job title, location (both employee residence 
and company location), remote work The arrangements, and company size. The 
dataset provides valuable insights into the compensation trends and variations in the 
field of data science from 2020 to 2024.
